      <p>Over the summer, I interned in Singapore at Zumata, a travel technology startup, where I worked closely with the Chief Operating Officer and two
      colleagues on marketing and lead generation initiatives. I worked with the team to <em> design, prototype, and pitch a chatbot proposal </em>for a mall client. Additionally, I also helped the startup
      improve their marketing strategy for the hotel industry by building an <em>email campaign</em>
      and creating <em>flyers and a proposal deck</em>.

    <h4>A.I. Chatbot for Mall</h4>
    <h5><span style="color: #00dada">&#8212;</span>Task<span style="color: #00dada">&#8212;</span></h5>
    <p>to AMK Hub to implement a chatbot technology on their website and Facebook Page.</p>

    <h5><span style="color: #00dada">&#8212;</span>User Research<span style="color: #00dada">&#8212;</span></h5>
    <p>Our team interviewed 3 people, a woman who lived her whole life in Singapore,  a University student, and the company CEO an expat from Arizona
      in order to gain a better understanding of people's needs and how their mall experiences can be improved.
      I utilized the user interviews to create user personas and guide the chatbot's features.</p>
    From our discussion, we highlighted the following pain points:
    <ul><li>Parking ticket is tedious to obtain.</li>
