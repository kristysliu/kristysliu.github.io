            <section>
              <p>In my Intro to Web Programming class, I created a website to share traveling advice and information about my past trips. I also incorporated a contact form for future suggestions and feedback on how I can improve the site.</p>

              <h5>Target Audience</h5>
              <div class = "sidehighlight">
                <p>TravelShare's target audience is young people (18-26 year old) such as high school, undergraduate, or graduate students interested in traveling. Whether they are browsing for ideas for next travel destinations, seeking tips to better plan their travels, or want to find opportunities to travel as a student, this site is catered to their needs. The design goals is for this site to be a resource for students like me to travel smart and make their desires to travel a reality.</p>

              <h5>Sketches & Iterations</h5>
              <div class = "sidehighlight">
                <p>In order to create an effective form, I created a sketch of the form's validation and pseudocode. </p>

              <h5>User Testing</h5>
              <div class = "sidehighlight">
                <p>I conducted two user testings for the contact form. An example of the information gathered during user testing is below. Using the feedback from users, I made changes to make TravelShare and the form easier to use.</p>

              <h5>Solution</h5>
              <div class = "sidehighlight">
                <p>The final website featured information about two destinations (Singpaore and Budapest), a blog, a page about my future travel plans, a resources page featuring travel opportunities, and a gallery. I designed the website to be easy-to-navigate and to act as a resource for students to plan trips and find more information about how to study, work, or volunteer abroad based on my own experiences. Images of the final website are shown below.</p>
