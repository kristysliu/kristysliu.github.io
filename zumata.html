    <section>
        <p>Over the summer, I interned in Singapore at Zumata, a travel technology startup, where I worked closely with the Chief Operating Officer and two
        colleagues on marketing and lead generation initiatives. I collaborated with the team to <em> design, prototype, and pitch a chatbot proposal </em>for a mall client. Additionally, I also helped the startup improve their marketing strategy for the hotel industry by building an <em>email campaign</em>
        and creating <em>flyers and a proposal deck</em>.</p>

        <h4>A.I. Chatbot for Mall</h4>
        <h5>Task</h5>
        <div class = "sidehighlight">
          <p>Create a pitch deck for AMK Hub on how implementing chatbot technology on their mall's website and Facebook Page can improve customer service. </p>
        </div>

        <h5>User Research</h5>
        <div class = "sidehighlight">
          <p>Our team spoke with 3 Singaporean locals in order to better understand shoppers' needs and their mall experiences.
            Using the interviews, 2 user personas were created to guide the chatbot's features.</p>
            Pain points:
          <ol>
            <li>Mall parking tickets are tedious to obtain (visitors have to wait in a queue with their purchase receipt to get free parking).</li>
            <li>The store directory is confusing.</li>
            <li>Searching for specific stores and products is inefficient.</li>
          </ol>
        </div>

        <h5>Process & Iterations</h5>
        <div class = "sidehighlight">
          <p>1: Brainstormed 10 possible functions, and outlined the 5 main categories that will appear when opening the chatbot: directions, directory, scanning store QR code, WiFi access, and further help.</p>
          <p>2: Modified the categories to 5 selections that will appear on the slider of buttons and drafted functions, initial dialogue flow, and potential questions the user could ask.</p>

        <h5>Solution</h5>
        <div class = "sidehighlight">
          <p>Constructed a pitch deck and dialogue flow for a chatbot with 8 key features: directions, item and store search, ordering food and beverage, favorites, entertainment and cinema, promotions, parking, and WiFi. Finalized a demo for AMK Hub and videos showing 2 user interactions with one user, who prefers being guided by buttons and another user who prefers a conversational approach.</p>
          <p>As part of our solution, we also highlighted the benefits of implementing a chatbot versus a mobile application.</p>
